# 🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict **medical insurance costs** based on individual attributes such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region. A **Linear Regression** model is used to analyze the relationship between these features and insurance charges.

The project demonstrates the complete **machine learning workflow**, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

  * `sex` – Gender
  * `bmi` – Body Mass Index
  * `children` – Number of dependents
  * `smoker` – Smoking status
  * `region` – Residential region
  * `charges` – Medical insurance cost (target variable)
